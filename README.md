# END-OF-DEGREE PROJECT

## Abstract
Melanoma is the skin cancer that causes the vast majority of deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Therefore, a quick and effective diagnosis is crucial for patients who may suffer from this disease. Where innovation is urgently needed to provide a solution to problems of late diagnosis, lack of helpful tools, superfluous consultations, and lack of prioritization of cases.

In order to offer a solution to these problems, this final degree project focuses on the research and resolution of an effective predictive model, capable of detecting melanomas in skin through an image, and the creation of a mobile application that incorporates this predictive model, which serves as a prototype of a health service to achieve a more effective diagnosis and prevention of melanoma skin cancer.

To do this, this report reflects the work carried out, where on the collection of images of benign and malignant melanoma tumors, provided by The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), we have achieved a validation during training of an area of 0.99354 on the AUC metric and 96.99% on the Accuracy metric, through the use of Transfer Learning methods, under a first layer with the EfficientNetB6 model.

In conclusion, it has been possible to establish a model comparable to the current state-of-the-art models with an efficiency of 96.99%, integrated in a Cloud-based software system and offered through a mobile application.
